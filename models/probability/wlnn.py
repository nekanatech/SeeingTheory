## The (weak) law of large numbers demonstration
### By A. S. Ahmann

This is a small streamlit app to demonstrate the weak law of large numbers (WLLN) by simulating a game of craps involving one (1) six-faced fair dice. The WLNN states that as the number of trials in a probability experiment incrases, the expected value of the sample space will match the true expected value of the random process being studied.

In the case of the hypothetical game of craps, the expected value is: 

$$ \mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{x = 1}^{6} (1/6) x = 3.5$$

To see this theorem "in action," move the slider below to increase or decrease the number of runs in the craps experiment. Everytime the slider is moved to a different value, it will rerun the experiment at the number of trials that it is set to.
